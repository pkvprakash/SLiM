Professor Montgomery-Smith will conduct research into the study of the cotype 2 constant of operators from C(K) to any Banach space. This is intended to fill a gap on what is already known about how cotype 2 relates to operators from C(K) which has so far dealt only with operators which factor through a space of cotype 2. This research will involve the study of Rademacher processes. This is a recent but very natural area. It takes as its starting point the well studied Gaussian processes. This research is at the interface of two fields: probability and operator theory on infinite dimensional spaces. Properties of operators (infinite dimensional matrices) are studied using ideas from probability and conversely the quest to understand these operators leads to new and interesting questions in pure probability.
