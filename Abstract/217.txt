The principal investigator will study the inference problems in the setting of asymptotic structures for dependence, distribution tails and characteristic functions. This research will be carried out in several general areas, including extremes of stationary sequences, partial sums of a stationary sequence and nonparametric function estimation. A number of new techniques will be developed, including the use of Fourier analysis to determine rates of convergence in nonparametric function estimation.
