This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the subfield of analytical fluorescence spectroscopy. Professor Warner will study interactions between cyclodextrans with a series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons using a suite of spectroscopic methods. This research will use infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography and fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate the molecule details of complexation between cyclodextrans and polyaromatic hydrocarbons together with the ternary effects arising from addition of alcohols. The results from this research will be useful in developing analytical measurements for naturally chiral compounds and for compounds with induced chirality.
