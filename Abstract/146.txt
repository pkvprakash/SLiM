The principal investigator will continue his work in the general area of empirical processes, paying particular attention to the development of asymptotic techniques that can be applied to non-standard problems in Statistics and Econometrics. Specific applications will include: the theory of least absolute deviations estimators in time series models; discrete choice models; and the extension of empirical process results for independent variables to cover various types of dependent variables.
