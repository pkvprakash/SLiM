Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include work at the interface between particle physics and cosmology and work motivated by the superstring models of the basic forces and particles. The cosmology - related research will deal with the role of quantum mechanics in the inflation of the universe and with the generation of galaxy - sized structure in the universe. This research addresses very important issues relating to the evolution of the universe.
