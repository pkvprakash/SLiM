A conventional scanning electron microscope will be acquired for use in a multiuser, campus-wide facility at Mississippi State University. The high resolution achievable with a research-grade scanning electron microscope is essential to the projects of six major users and six minor users from diverse disciplines. The former projects deal with the morphology of (1) fossil ostracods, (2) sensory receptors of water mites, (3) scent organs of moths, (4) seed coverings, (5) moth sensory organs and organs of host plants, and (6) fossil and recent diatoms. The projects of the six minor users deal with (1) intestinal nutrient transport in piglets, (2) particle sizing, (3) fungal infection of plant tissue, (4) paleomagnetism, (5) fungus and nematode colonization of roots, and (6) crustacean blood clotting and wound healing.
