The following is an award to engage in research aimed at understanding and exploring experimentally the ultra high speed potential of quantum well lasers. The recent advances in quantum layer understanding and growth now make the prospects of subpicosecond pulses at rates greater than 100 GHz a distinct possibility. It is proposed to pursue this goal using our combined crystal growth (MBE, LPE), microwave, picosecond pulse, and simulation capabilities.
