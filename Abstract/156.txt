This award will help fund a conference in singularity theory. This conference will be held from August 6 to 10, 1990 on the campus of the University of Hawaii, Manoa. This conference will be concerned with all branches of singularity theory, but with emphasis on the following: (1) singularities of mappings (real or complex), (2) singularities of real varieties, (3) foundational properties: differential analysis, subanalytic sets, etc., and (4) applications, e.g., to differential geometry.
