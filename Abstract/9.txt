Work on two kinds of nonclassical states is proposed. The first are states whose phase is correlated with their ampli- tude. States of this kind can be detected by measuring their noise after they have passed through a Kerr medium. The objective is to develop a formalism for describing the phase/amplitude correlations for such states. The second set of states to be studied are the so called squeezed states. In particular, those states which are squeezed in the mode ampli- tudes (quadratic squeezing). Three basic forms of quadratic squeezing have already been examined and it is proposed to study the nature of mixed forms of these states. Here, non-linear interactions can transform different types of quadratically squeezed states among themselves. These trans- formations will be studied in some detail in the proposal.
