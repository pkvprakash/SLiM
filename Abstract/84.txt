The principal investigators will investigate several questions in stochastic analysis, most of which involve white noise calculus and its applications. In particular, they will study the localization of forward and backward integrals, multiple stochastic integrals, existence and uniqueness of stochastic differential equations with anticipating coefficients, comparison with other approaches in the theory of anticipating stochastic differential equations.
