This research is on theory and implementation of VLSI chips for a neural type cell in the nodes of a neural network. The design is based on the model of transmission of information from the human eye to the visual cortex. The technique for implementing the model is pulse coded neural type circuits. A theory is being developed to explain the relationship between the frequency generated by neural type circuits and the input voltage level. Neural type cells are being designed, fabricated, and measured to test the theory and verify designs.
