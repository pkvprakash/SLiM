This award supports an international workshop on applied mechanics to be held in Valparaiso, Chile from January 2-5, 1991. The U.S. organizer is Dean Mook of Virginia Polytechnic Institute; his counterpart in Chile is Pablo Kittl of the University of Chile in Santiago. The interaction organizing and editorial committee consists of engineers from Brazil, Canada, Argentina, Venezuela and Chile as well as from the u.S. The objectives of the workshop are 1) to expose engineers and scientists as well as graduate students to new research findings, techniques and problems and 2) to provide opportunities for personal interactions among the mechanical from all the Americans through formal lectures and informal conversations. There will be a special session with a panel of well-known engineers from both Americans to discuss how to further open channels of communication and to foster future collaboration between North and South America. In addition there were 45 abstracts received in Chile. Such a level of interest on both sides makes this opportunity for interaction between U.S. and Latin American engineers and scientists along with the attendance of graduate students a good example of the fulfillment of the goals of the Science in Developing Countries program.
