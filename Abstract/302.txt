Acquiring a transmission electron microscope would greatly strengthen research opportunities in cell, molecular, and developmental biology at Wright State University. Students taking our research-oriented course in electron microscopy or doing a research project using electron microscopy will have the opportunity to use modern equipment that is flexible, reliable, and comparable to facilities available in commercial laboratories or major research institutions nationwide. Specific research opportunities for undergraduates include the projects outlined in this proposal: (1) the influence of gravity on plant growth and development, (2) cuticular and gut ultrastructure of Sarcoptes scabiei from susceptible and resistant hosts, (3) growth and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, (4) morphological adaptation of avian osmoregulatory organs to changing physiological demands, and (5) secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system.
