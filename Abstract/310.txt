This research program is to learn about the behavior of liquid mixtures near solid boundaries. The work is primarily experimental. The fundamental issues are the nature of the boundary states, including their microscopic structure; the role and origins of short and long range substrate-liquid interactions; the importance of thermal fluctuations; and the response to thermodynamic forces both in and out of equilibrium. There are three main projects: First, a capillary rise exploration of the transitions between states of wetting at bulk coexistence. The variables here are temperature and the chemistry of the bulk liquids and the substrates. Second, optical studies of the polarization and intensity of reflected light from liquid-solid interfaces as a means of uncovering microscopic features of equilibrium wetting layer structure. Third, the exploration of the nonequilibrium response of wetting structures to temperature changes with time and fluid motion. The aim here is to learn about otherwise inaccessible regimes of equilibrium response as well as time-dependent phenomena. As a supplementary project, they will join with the research group of Benjamin Widom to study the interfacial structure and energy of phase-separated polymer solutions through reflectivity and capillary rise experiments.
