The use of real time, computationally intensive graphical methods as diagnostical procedures in statistical problems will be explored. Residuals in high dimensional regression problems will be studied by means of restricted grand tours. Innovative computational procedures such as slicing regressions to find structure will be examined. This procedure is semiparametric rather than nonparametric and promises to yield useful results when a few basic assumptions are satisfied. Furthermore novel graphical summaries of uncertainty will be explored in high dimensional problems.
