Dr. Nancy E. Levinger has been awarded a Postdoctoral Resaerch Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Levinger's doctoral degree was from the University of Colorado under the supervision of Professor W. Carl Lineberger. Dr. Levinger intends to continue research at the University of Minnesota under the sponsorship of Professor Paul Barbara. Dr. Levinger's area of training and research will be the role of solvation in chemical reactions at a molecular level. Femtosecond spectroscopy will be used to distinguish solvent-mediated intermolecular charge-transfer reactions from intramolecular charge-transfer reactions. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
