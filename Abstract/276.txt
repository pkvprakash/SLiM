This a 4-year project to investigate (1) greenhouse-gas- induced equilibrium climate change (2) greenhouse-gas-induced transient climate change, and (3) cloud optical depth feedback. A coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM will be used to perform several 100 year climate simulations under different C02 radiative forcing scenarios. This investigation is important because it's successful completion will help determine whether it is possible to detect the greenhouse signal in the climate record of the past 100 years, and whether changes in cloud optical depth act to enhance or diminish global warming.
