This research in mathematical physics will use the renormalization group technique to analyze the short and long distance behavior of mathematical models with many (and infinite) degrees of freedom. The specific topics include establishing infrared asymptotic freedom for the effective photon interaction in quantum electrodynamics, studying the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase of the two dimensional classical Coulomb gas, examining the solutions to the time-dependent Landau-Ginsburg equation near the critical point, establish the free photon field as the continuum limit for a (1) gauge theory with Wilson action, further study the short distance behavior of non-Abelian gauge theories.
