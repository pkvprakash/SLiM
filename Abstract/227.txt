Research will be conducted on the subject of generalized linear regression models which are extensions of classical statistical regression and analysis-of-variance models, providing a unified approach to the analysis of counted, categorical, and response-time data. The work will focus on methods for dealing with random errors in explanatory variables, and methods allowing for more random variation in response variables than is consistent with natural generalized linear models such as the binomial or Poisson. The two problems are closely related since errors in explanatory variables induce additional variation in response variables. Methods to be analyzed have been developed for non-normally distributed data and find application in radiation dose-response analyses for survivor data where there is substantial uncertainty in individual exposure estimates.
