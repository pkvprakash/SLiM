This proposed work aims to measure the low temperature and high pressure properties of beta- and beta"-alumina, and beta"-alumina containing various divalent and trivalent ions. The high purity materials to be investigated will be prepared in-house. Information on the transport properties and internal structure and mechanisms of these materials are of great technological interest both as fast ion conductors and optical materials and laser hosts.
