Professor Gordon will continue to investigate problems in the topology of low-dimensional manifolds, especially those related to knot theory. A particular topic that will receive attention is Dehn surgery on knots and links, a construction that is relevant to many fundamental questions concerning the structure of 3-dimensional manifolds. The structure of three-dimensional manifolds, very natural geometric objects of the same dimension as the space in which we live, remains an important and surprisingly mysterious subject for mathematical investigation.
