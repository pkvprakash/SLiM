This project focuses on molecular systematics and biogeography of the fish genus Gambusia (Cyprinodontiformes, Poeciliidae). Samples of up to about 45 nominal species will be collected from Caribbean islands, Central America, and the southeastern United States in order to examine phylogenetic and zoogeographic relationships. Results from electophoresis and mitochondrial DNA restriction site analysis will be used to construct a phylogeny for the genus. These data are to be combined with morphological information, which thus far has been inconclusive in resolving taxonomy, to examine character congruence. Zoogeographic evidence will be compared to area cladograms constructed for other monophyletic taxa (of a single ancestral origin) available in the scientific literature in order to test hypothesized vicariant events in the Caribbean region. The work will be performed at Auburn University by Charles Lydeard under the direction of Dr. Michael C. Wooten.
