Professor Iozzi will conduct research in the application of ergodic theory to the study of group actions on manifolds or more generally on measure spaces. In particular she will apply techniques from this area, as well as methods of representation theory and the theory of algebraic groups, to a variety of questions involving connected transformation groups and their discrete subgroups. Examples of such questions are invariance phenomena for geometric structures and related issues on the compactification of algebraic varieties, orbit equivalence of actions, and the structural study of the diffeomorphism group of a manifold. This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
