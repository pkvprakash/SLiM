The source of ore fluids and their interactions with host rocks are of considerable concern in the understanding of the Mississippi Valley-type of Lead-Zinc deposits. In southeast Missouri there is a strong possibility that multiple basinal fluids were involved and indicate a more complex origin for sulfide orebodies in the region than previously modeled. This project will utilize sulfur isotope variations throughout the paragenetic sequence of sulfide deposition for a number of mines in the Viburnum Trend of the Southeast Missouri Lead-Zinc district. Results should clarify the role of successive pulses of ore-forming fluids and their interaction with host rocks.
