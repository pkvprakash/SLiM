The International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics will hold its 10th International Biophysics Congress and General Assembly in Vancouver, Canada, July 29 to August 3, 1990. The meeting offers a broad program of symposia on topics of current biophysical interest such as: 1) membrane organization and function; 2) macromolecular structure function recognition; 3) biophysical techniques; and 4) cell and bioenergetics. Scientists of international reputation have been selected to serve as invited participants. In addition, poster sessions will provide for the latest research results to be discussed in detail. This meeting provides the opportunity for U.S. scientists to meet outstanding foreign scientists, to present their work to an international audience and to, perhaps, begin important international collaborations.
