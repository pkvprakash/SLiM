This renewal of Dr. Davis' previous grant, IRI-8801529, will support further development of his logic-based representation for commonsense spatial and perceptual reasoning. Past efforts have developed a theory of qualitative spatial and physical reasoning for predicting interactions of moving objects and behaviors of kinematic chains. New work will focus on a strategic planner for simulated and real robots, with emphasis on the use of knowledge in planning of perceptual actions.
