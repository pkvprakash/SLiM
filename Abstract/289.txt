This project is to establish a U.S. national panel on structural control research for seismic and wind resistant design. The objective is to establish a sound knowledge basis for research, to develop a national R&D program for the active control of structures, and to conduct a collaborative planning study project with a counterpart panel in Japan established by the Japan Science Agency. A plan of action will be developed which consists of possible multi-national efforts involving collaborative projects, exchange of personnel, jointly organized experiments, and exchange of data and technical information, etc. The activities will involve researchers from academic field, industry, and government laboratories. The programs will be carried out under the general auspices of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). The effort will bring about accelerated implementation of an emerging technology in active structural control which holds great promise for reducing structural damages for seismic and wind loadings.
