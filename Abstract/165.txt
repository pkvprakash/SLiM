This project is concerned with the representation theory of finite groups. The principal investigator will examine the endomorphism rings of permutation modules in characteristic p, Alperin's conjecture and related questions, and central units of finite order in blocks of RG. The postdoctoral associate will study modular Hecke algebras and quadratic G-modules in characteristic two. This research is in the general area of the representation theory of finite groups. One of the main applications of group theory to other mathematical and scientific fields is in representation theory.
