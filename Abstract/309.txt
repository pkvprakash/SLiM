This dissertation represents one of the first attempts to assess the structure of work organization and labor processes in a service industry. Most previous work has been confined to manual workers in manufacturing industries. This study examines the labor process in the hospital setting of a community health care system. It examines the social goals and rationales behind the design and deployment of hospital technologies and medical innovations and the complex relationship between technological change and the structure of work organization.
