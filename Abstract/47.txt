The grant provides partial funding for the Sixth International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy, being held on the campus of the University of California, San Diego, August 26-31, 1990. The scope of the conference covers the entire spectrum of molecular beam epitaxy, for example, growth of materials, processing and characterization, growth physics, device physics, and properties and structure of thin films. The funds will be used to provide partial support for participation by graduate students and young scientists. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Journal of Crystal Growth.
