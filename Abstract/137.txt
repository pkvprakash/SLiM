This is a proposal to build cost-effective specialized computers for scientific computation. A set of hardware and software will be developed to allow rapid construction of very specialized computers: computers that are capable of running exactly one program. The computers are built from many data path parts, interconnected to reflect the control flow of the program to be executed. Several of these computers are under construction for different problems, including the n-body problem of predicting planetary motions, some electronic simulation problems, and large-scale particle simulations. Comparison with other computational approaches to this problem will allow an accurate evaluation of this technique.
