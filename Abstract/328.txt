This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) has at its aim to explore the effect of electric fields on immiscible mixtures of polymers. Preliminary work has shown that phases can be distorted and aligned by this method. The planned research will investigate the mechanism by which different morphologies can be obtained, and the anisotropies in such properties as conductivity or dielectric constant in films subjected to electric fields.
