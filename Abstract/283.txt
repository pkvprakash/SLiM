The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to discuss the recent findings and current thinking in various areas of science. Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of established scientists, young investigators who are making important contributions in these areas and postdoctoral fellows. They are held in small, isolated New England towns away from other distractions and conducive to the exchange of ideas. These conferences have a recognized value for presenting the latest advances in research and also indicating the future trends which are likely to be most productive.
