This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Dr. Joseph J. Grabowski at Harvard University. The results of this investigation will provide new insights into the fundamental details of the processes by which chemical reactions take place. Dr. Grabowski will employ the Flowing Afterglow and Selected Ion Flow Tube techniques to examine, probe, and define mechanisms of gas-phase, organic, ion-molecule reactions. Competitive reactions will be employed so that accurate product ratios will provide direct information about the alternative reaction channels in the absence of solvent effects. Both positive-ion and negative-ion systems will be studied, and the investigation will focus on comparisons of such reaction pairs as elimination-substitution, competitive H-atom transfers, and reactions at differently hybridized carbon centers in the same molecule.
