This project is concerned with work in algebra, particularly in descent theory and its applications. This will include work on the structure and cohomology of affine algebraic group schemes, with emphasis on those arising as automorphisms of other structures. One area of application will be the structure of nonclassical simple Lie algebras in positive characteristics. A second application will be to Galois extensions of commutative rings. A third will be to the twisted forms of determinants. This research covers a wide range of topics in algebra. In particular, areas related to affine group schemes and descent theory will be considered. The results will provide insight into many areas of algebra.
