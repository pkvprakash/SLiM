This study examines the following problems, (1) cumulus- stratocumulus transition in the oceanic boundary layer for FIRE and ASTEX, (2) land surface interaction for FIFE, and (3) radiative-convective coupling in the boundary layer. This study is important because it will help us to improve our conceptual framework for future experiments such as TOGA/COARE; and to develop better parametric models for the convective boundary layer in climate and forecast models.
