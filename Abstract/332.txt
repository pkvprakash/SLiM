The application of this state-of-the-art Solid State NMR Spectrometer is for the characterization of traditional and unique materials formed from various types of composites, polymer blends, glasses, and ceramics. Detection of various nuclei of H, C, N, Al, Si, and P isotopes are included, along with studies of polymers used in non-linear optics and membranes for separation technology. Other materials include organometallic precursors to nitrides and carbides, organic precursors to inorganic ceramics, and various intermediates involved in the calcination process.
