This dissertation proposal investigates changes in men's and women's strategies to move through the marriage-divorce- remarriage process. She uses social exchange theory, a microstructural approach to human agency, and network influences in the construction of reality. The goal of the research is to learn how change, as well as consistency, in strategies used by each gender is affected by dependency on marriage, the reason for divorce, and the person's social network. The student will survey 200 remarried individuals (100 couples) and interview a subsample of 50 couples.
