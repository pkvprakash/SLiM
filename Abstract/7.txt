This project involves a study of recovery, reconstruction and mitigation activities in Charleston, South Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo. The research will have three primary goals. First, to examine reconstruction policies in relationship to their impact upon mitigation. Second, to analyze the influence of hazard reduction activities in one area (seismic hazards) upon the impact and recovery from a related, though different, hazard. Third, to study the effect of place specific sense of community upon the reconstruction and mitigation processes. Data sources will include interviews with officials, a survey of households, and relevant documents and reports.
