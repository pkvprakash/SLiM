The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of modifying Bacillus expression systems which will allow vegetative cells to continuously produce and secrete proteins. Very little is known about the capabilities of vegetative cells to synthesize and secrete proteins. The modified expression systems could serve as a basis for new recombinant DNA technology for efficient production of commercially important Bacillus exoenzymes and heterologous foreign proteins.
