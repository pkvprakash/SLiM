Columbia University hosts two Theory Days annually, one in the spring and one in the fall. Each theory day consists of four one-hour invited talks on current research results. In addition, there is ample time for questions and informal discussions on a range of theoretical topics. Typically 100-150 people attend. This project supports four theory days, beginning with the Spring 1990 theory day.
