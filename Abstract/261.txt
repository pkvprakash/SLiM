This proposal describes a possible method for transforming Drosophila embryos by injecting them with defined oligonucleotides. If the nucleotide sequences substitute for the normal gene, mutation will be produced. Putative mutations will be confirmed by breeding tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnoses. This is a high risk effort with a large payoff if successful. If it works at a reasonable rate, the transformation of Drosophila will be greatly simplified if not become routine.
