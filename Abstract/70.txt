The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Leon Chua of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Tamas Roska of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' Computer and Automation Research Institute is to investigate mixed-mode nonlinear computing structures. Efforts will include three areas of emphasis: 1) determining the qualitative relationships between analog and digital realizations of canonical nonlinear information processing architectures; 2) simulating the quantitative problems of nonlinear programming circuits and cellular neural networks; and 3) furthering functional design of a mixed-mode nonlinear processing element to exploit analog dynamics and logical decisions. Results are expected to extend nonlinear circuit theory and may lead to a better undertanding of the operational limits of existing digitally-realized networks and new nonlinear analog and mixed-mode computing. This project in computer science fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
