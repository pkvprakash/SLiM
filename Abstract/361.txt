This program aims to obtain basic engineering information on the kinetics of feeding, growth, and reproduction of the organism Tetrahymena pyriformis. Emphasis is placed on observing distributions of single cell properties and developing models for prediction of how such distributions change in response to changes in environmental conditions. Flow cytometry is the principal experimental tool used to obtain the desired data. This technique allows rapid and accurate determination of how various properties of single cells are jointly distributed among the many cells in a population, and it can also be used to provide quantitative information on the spatial distribution of some materials, like DNA, in a single cell.
