This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program will enable twenty U.S. graduate students to attend the XIV International Conference on Organometallic Chemistry in Detroit, Michigan, August 19-24, 1990. The conference is expected to attract more than 500 scientists with demonstrated research interests in organometallic chemistry and particularly its applications in new materials. The primary goals of the 1990 meeeting are to provide opportunities for full participation both to young researchers in the United States and to scientists from less-developed nations, to stimulate interaction between academic and industrial chemists in the U.S., and to provide a forum for the latest developments in the broad field of organometallic chemistry.
