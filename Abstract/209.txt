Professor Wogen will investigate several questions in the theory of Hilbert space operators. These questions involve various notions of reflexivity for such operators. In addition the structure of the algebra of all operators which commute with a given operator will be investigated and finally Professor Wogen will examine the structure of certain types of composition operators. Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. These operators have applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify certain important classes of such objects.
