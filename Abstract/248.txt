This is a cooperative research project between the University of Missouri (UMR) and the National Cheng-Kung University (NCKU) in Taiwan, to study the seismic behavior and design of reinforced concrete low-rise shear walls and building systems with openings. NCKU will perform experimental and UMR will conduct analytical studies. The objectives are: 1) mathematical formulation of load- deflection of walls with coupling deformations of bending, shear, axial,and bond slip, 2) evaluation of stiffness reduction of walls and structural systems after cracks, 3) development of hysteresis models for bendings, shear and axial, based on coupling behavior, 4) evaluation of damping coefficients at various deformation stages, 5) statistical studies of design parameters of reduction factor, ductility and damage index, 6) correlation of the analytical and experimental results. Recommendations for building code revisions/improvements will be made for engineering practice.
