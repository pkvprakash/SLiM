The National Supercomputer Facility at Cornell University will select 20 undergraduate students from around the country to learn about supercomputers and to learn how they can be used to solve important scientific problems. These students and their institutional advisers will be brought to Cornell during the summer of 1990 to learn about supercomputer technologies and to define a problem requiring computationally intense solutions. The students will complete their projects for academic credit after returning to their home institutions. This program provides a unique learning opportunity for students from small colleges as well as for women and minority students who will be especially recruited.
