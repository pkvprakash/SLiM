This dissertation proposal examines the consequences of tourism for restructuring regional economies and polities, through a study of elite sponsorship of the traditional art of an indigenous group. Using models from the sociology of culture and organizational theory, the student will identify the causes and consequences of the Indian Arts Fund's sponsorship of a revival of traditional Pueblo pottery production in New Mexico in the 1920s and 1930s.
