This study will address two substantive questions about a mathematical model relating affect and identity in affect- control theory. First, the dissertation student will test hypotheses derived from affect-control theory. Second, she will extend the affect-control theory model by examining the implications of her study for interaction potential, or the probability that two people will choose to interact. The project will consist of two experiments using data collected from undergraduate volunteers.
