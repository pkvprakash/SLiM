This dissertation research explores the tension between feminist critiques of bureaucracy and feminist organizational practice. The student will conduct the study in three stages. In the first she will examine questions of external and internal influences on organizational structure by means of a self- administered questionnaire. In the second she will examine changes in organizational form through semi-structured telephone interviews with members of 20 organizations. She will then try in the third stage to explain why some groups are better able to maintain alternative organizational structures. Information will be gathered through participant observation in three organizations representative of the range of organizational forms.
