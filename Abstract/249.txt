This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at Trinity College to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduate Site. The program will provide minority students with research opportunities in test construction and validation. The project contains two components: (1) a short course on psychological measurement that concentrates on personality test construction, and (2) student-initiated research on the same topic. In addition to learning the theory underlying the development and validation of personality tests, students will learn methods for gathering information to test hypotheses and will gain experience with scientific reasoning. Following the course, small groups of students will develop and conduct research projects designed to test the validity of an assessment instrument. Students will prepare written research reports and will present their results orally to project participants and other audiences. Successful projects will be presented at undergraduate and professional conferences. Students recruited for this program primarily will be African-American and Hispanic college students who formerly participated in a college preparation program entitled "Career Beginnings."
