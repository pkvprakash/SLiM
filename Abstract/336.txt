This project is concerned with research on the valuation theory of division algebras finite-dimensional over their centers. A particular focus is the further study of Dubrovin valuation rings. A ring is an algebraic object having an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Rings occur naturally in many different settings in mathematics. This project is concerned with an important class of rings called division algebras.
