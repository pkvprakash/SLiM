This investigation, by one of the leaders in the field of cosmo- logical modeling, combines two approaches to the basic problem of understanding the origin of large-scale structure in our uni- verse. The first approach is to work out the consequences of theoretical models using N-body simulations with far greater dynamic range than any previously performed, spanning at least 7.5 orders of magnitude in mass and 3 in distance. With more than 100 times as many particles as nearly all previous cosmolog- ical simulations, this project is expected to yield much improved tests of the inflationary universe paradigm with dark matter and biased galaxy formation. The second approach will investigate the theoretical implications of large-scale deviations from uniform Hubble expansion. A newly developed technique will be applied to galaxy redshift-distance samples to reconstruct the three-dimensional potential, velocity, and mass density fields. Possible systematic errors will be closely investigated with the goal of deriving more accurate relative galaxy distances.
