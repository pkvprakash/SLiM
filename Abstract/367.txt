This project examines transient liquid phase bonding with the aim of modeling this joining process and determining the effects of processing variables. The approach is aimed at predicting those alloy systems that respond to transient liquid phase bonding and quantifying important features of the process, such as the solidification kinetics, effects of solid solubility and phase equilibria, influence of surface tensions, generic design of interlayers, etc. Out of this research a clear rationale for design of interlayers based on thermodynamic and transport properties of the materials' systems should evolve. Potential future applications include transient liquid phase bonding of electronic packaging, advanced metal matrix composites, ceramic- to-metal bonding, and reactive metal joining.
