Research focuses on development of models for performance evaluation of the following types of queueing systems: (i) polling systems, where a central computer polls terminals that share a single transmission channel (such as a token ring LAN) and (ii) database systems, where records are inserted into and deleted from file structures called buckets. The study will include both the development of the underlying mathematical theory of queues (such as the fundamental M/G/1 model, vacation models, cyclic- service models and multiserver systems with ordered hunt) and the practical application to the performance analysis for real systems.
