The research will be in three area: 1) density functional theory, 2) surface physics, 3) quantum diffusion. The main emphasis in the first area will be density functional theory for high-temperature superconductors. Work in surface physics includes atom-surface scattering, recoilless scattering for very heavy atoms, inelastic scattering involving soft phonon production, and plasmons in small structures. The research in quantum diffusion includes studying hydrogen in or on vibrating solids and the analysis of quantum diffusion in a static disordered potential.
