An investigation of quantum effects in very thin metal films and metal clusters prepared by vapor-deposition on to substrates held at liquid He temperatures. Secondly, a study of the electric and magnetic properties of selected superconducting (sc) wire network and wire proximity array geometries as models for aspects of percolation, localization, and the (sc) glass.
