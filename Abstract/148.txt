This award will provide support to a group from Southeastern Massachusetts University to pursue their research in elementary particle physics. They are involved in a diverse program at Brookhaven National Laboratory to study the basic constituents of matter, quarks and gluons. The experiments are performed with a large particle detector known as the multiparticle spectrometer for which the SMU physicists have made important contributions to the apparatus and are now involved in the data analysis. The newest of these experiments is a major program in hadron spectroscopy designed to detect multiple gamma final states for the search and the unambiguous identification of various meson states.
