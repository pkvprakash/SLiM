The research in mathematical statistics is divided into three parts: testing for overdispersion in discrete distributions, testing that a sample comes from a normal distribution rather than a finite mixture of normal distributions, and semi-parametric estimation of a mixed normal density. A new test will be constructed for the presence of a mixture. Also a new test and diagnostic for the number of components in a mixture will be derived. This will be achieved by exploiting the geometry of ratios of mixed and unmixed densities. A further goal is to estimate the mixed normal density using an approach in which a smoothing parameter is selected via cross- validation.
