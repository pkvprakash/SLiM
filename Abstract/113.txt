Professor Radin will continue his research on the question of why certain types of matter are in an ordered state at low temperature. Recent results have shown that generically, perfect (crystalline) order at zero temperature is not to be expected. Radin's research will involve nonperiodic tilings and uniquely ergodic symbolic dynamical systems to determine the range of disorder that can be produced at zero and low temperature.
