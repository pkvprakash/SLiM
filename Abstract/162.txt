This proposal provides funds for a three year program leading to the implementation of an enhanced incoherent scatter data acquisition system at the Millstone Hill I.S. Radar Facility. Some funding has been previously provided by the NSF for the construction of a state-of-the-art data acquisition system known as MIDAS (Millstone Ionospheric Data Acquisition System). Hardware for a second such system has been provided by the Office of Naval Research (ONR). This proposal calls for constructing a second MIDAS systems.***//
