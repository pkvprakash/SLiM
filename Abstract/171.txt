This dissertation is a study of Japanese youth culture. It focuses on the relationship of societal opportunities provided by education to commitment to academic performance in a sample of vocational and regular high school students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Two methods of collecting data will be employed. Students and their mothers will be surveyed on their values, and a qualitative observation will focus on lifestyles of the two high school groups. This study will provide data that may be useful in encouraging academic performance among American high school students.
