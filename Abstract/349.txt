The principle investigator will study the inverse scattering problem by using two mathematical methods called the Wiener-Hopf factorization of operators and the generalized Muskhelishvili-Vekua method. Besides being powerful tools to solve an important problem in physics, the methods of this proposal will also contribute to various pure and applied areas of mathematics such as operator theory, functional analysis, partial differential equations, integral equations, and complex analysis.
