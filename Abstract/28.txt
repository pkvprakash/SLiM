The topics of investigation range over a wide spectrum in probability and statistics. They include probability problems arising from Computer Science, random trees, asymptotic theory of prediction regions and of confidence regions, distances between empirical processes and their Gaussian counterparts, minimum distance methods, stochastic estimation procedures, inference for time series with infinite variance, non-parametric function estimation, set statistics, and contour estimation. Many of the studies will be computer intensive.
